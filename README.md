# Challenge Checker

## Description

A small utility to check the progress of my coding challenges. It's not very
useful for anyone else, but I'm putting it out there in case someone wants to explore a 
cli utility written in Rust.

## Usage

TODO

## Build and Install

As with any Rust project, you can build and install this utility with `cargo`:

```bash

cargo build --release
cargo install --path .
```
## Install from gitlab

```bash


cargo install --git https://github.com/mukund-kri/challenge-tracker --branch main
```

## License

None. Do whatever you want with this code.
